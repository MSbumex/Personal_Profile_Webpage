        <h3>Aspiration in Life</h3>
<p>
  I aspire to become a <strong>Cloud Engineer</strong> and 
  <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>.  
  My dream is to learn how to build secure, reliable, and easy-to-use systems that can help people and businesses.  
  I want to create applications and platforms that are simple for users but powerful behind the scenes.  
  By learning both cloud technology and full-stack development, I hope to connect how systems work in the background with how people experience them in everyday life.
